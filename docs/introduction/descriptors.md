# Descriptors

DAENN is designed to work with a structural molecular descriptor called extended Social PeRmutation INvarianT (xSPRINT) coordinates.
xSPRINT is developed on top of the SPRINT coordinates. However, the DAENN can be trained using features generated by any descriptors 
which can serve unsupervised machine learning model.
