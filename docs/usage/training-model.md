# Train DAENN model with DeepCV

Training a DAENN CVs model with DeepCV is very easy. 
All parameters needed for model training are defined in one input file that you just setup in the previous step.
On this page, you will learn how to use the `daenn` code script to train a CV of the Diels-Alder reaction of 
ethene and 1,3-butadiene. The reference paper is 
[https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jpclett.1c04004](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jpclett.1c04004).

> Note that the current version of DeepCV accepts only datasets that are in NumPy's compressed file formats (.npz).

## Train model

Execute the `main.py` script with argument `daenn` and followed by `--input` or `-i` flag with the path to input file 
(e.g. [input_ae_DA.json](https://gitlab.uzh.ch/lubergroup/deepcv/-/blob/master/input/input_ae_DA.json)). 
The training time depends on the size of the dataset, the complexity of a neural net, the number of epochs, etc.
The following example is the training on dataset of 99,000 configurations of ethene and 1,3-butadiene.

```sh
$ python deepcv/src/main.py daenn --input input_ae_DA.json

```

Once you see the line `=== DONE===`, the training is successfully completed.
You can then use the files saved in the output folder you specified in the input file for further post-training works, 
e.g., use the trained model to generate CVs.

## Outputs

DeepCV saves autoencoder, encoder, and decoder models separately in the respective output directory.
