# Overview of Installing DeepCV

The source code of DeepCV is available free of charge for academic purposes upon the request of users. Please contact us for the codes.

The easiest way to install DeepCV is to use a Python package manager. You can use `pip` (standard manager) or `conda` (another manager framework). 
However, we suggest you create a separate working space for DeepCV to prevent redundancy of the package dependencies and/or version confusion with other programs.

For the developers who want to contribute to the DeepCV, we suggest you compile and install the source code manually. More details are available in the following section.
