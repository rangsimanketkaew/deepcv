# Overview of Installing DeepCV

The easiest way to install DeepCV is to use a Python package manager. It can be installed via standard manager `pip` or `conda` (another manager framework). 
However, before doing that, one should create a separate working space for DeepCV to prevent redundancy of the package dependencies.

For the developers who want to contribute to the DeepCV, it is suggested to compile and install the source code manually. More details are available in the following section.
