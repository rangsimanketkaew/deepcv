# Why DeepCV?

DeepCV is a deep learning framework for training a machine learning model on molecular representations to learn collective variables (CVs). DeepCV implements the so-call deep learning autoencoder neural network (DAENN) which makes use of the sophisticated symmetric feedforward multilayer perception to extract the latent space of the data and smartly generates non-linear CVs. Our algorithm also adopts a newly developed nuclear representation called eXtended Social PeRmutation INvarianT (xSPRINT) and applies the min-max custom loss function for smartly learn unexplored configurational space. The recent work also shows that the DAENN can successfully calculate free energy surface (FES) of a set of chemical reactions, yielding accurate thermodynamic properties such as free energy of activations compared to other biasing methods and experimental values.
